### Do you want to know your death date?
---
This React application can be very helpful.

Fill in the form, entering your:
- date of birth,
- country,
- sex.

In return you will get your predicted death date, based on the information from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy](List of countries by life expectancy).

It will also show you the lived and the remaining time in percents.
